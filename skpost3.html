        a glimpse at the brand new indoor park they just opened! 
        <br><br>
        i can't believe how real they've managed to make the sky look, heard these are the new screen models coming out this year
        <br><br>
        also i think they imported real dirt from the outside! but i'm sure they cleaned it first, that stuff outside can't be good for you...
        <br><br>
        anyone else been here yet? planning on taking my family there for our annual meetup. it's been so long, but when you're busy and you can call them so easily it doesn't even feel like it sometimes :p
