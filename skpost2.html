       I'm an avid coffee drinker but I'm trying matcha these days.
        <br><br>
        apparently it's supposed to give me a more sustained caffeine boost throughout the day which i could really use, especially at work
        <br><br>
        i think it's supposed to help with my sleep schedule, something about L-theanine promoting alertness but without the crazy crash coffee gives me? 
        <br><br>
        has anybody else made the switch? has it worked for you?
