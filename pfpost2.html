        I miss when the sky looked like this and you didn't need to pay to see it.

        How long will you ignore those of us who are living outside, those of us who can't afford the screens and have to live with the mess you're making.
        <br><br>
        We're struggling to breathe without the same conditions as you, and our access to food and basic neccessities are getting worse.
        <br><br>
        Even our access to bus stops are declining. Now they're all walled up and connected right to your apartment buildings to protect you from the pollution outside. 
        <br><br>
        These days, you don't even have to step foot outside. But for us, it's our everyday reality.
