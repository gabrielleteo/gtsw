        This is your chance. YOU can help us. 
        <br><br>
        Help us reverse the government's implementation of ABC(V) screens on public transport. Don't let them stop you from seeing the reality EVERYWHERE YOU GO.
        <br><br>
        Did you know that only 10% of solar panels are recycled? MOST OF THEM are replaced before they reach the end of their lifespan because a newer, more efficient model is released.
        <br><br>
        ABC(V) wants you to think that solar panels are the most environmentally friendly way, but in reality it is generating millions of tonnes of waste. 
        <br><br>
        You might argue, 'But they have a recycling scheme in place!'
        <br><br>
        Whilst the government does pay you out for depositing used solar panels at their recycling plants, 90% of the time they aren't being recycled. Often, a $50 incentive per solar panel is more cost-efficient than hiring a team to clean up the mess before future building projects. 
        <br><br>
        Don't let them decide your future for you. OPEN YOUR EYES, decide for yourself what you want to see happen.
