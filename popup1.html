        I'm guessing you've clicked on this page because you've tried everything but nothing's worked. 
        <br><br>
        You think maybe it's your diet or your workout routine, or worst of all someone at ABC(V) has convinced you that you just have to upgrade a larger range of calming nighttime screens.
        <br><br>
        Why would they suggest this in the first place, unless there's something stopping you from sleeping when you're supposed to?
        <br><br>

        <b>LET ME GUESS.. </b>

        Your company offers a complimentary shuttle to get to and from work. They make you pay EXTRA if you want to take your own self-driving car.
        <br><br>
        When you head home its always around sunset time, there's a beautiful pink and orange sunset outside the shuttle windows but when you get home its 8PM and you didn't even realise. 
        <br><br>
        You're exhausted and you try to sleep but something keeps you awake. 
        <br><br>
        <div style="font-family: 'Oxanium'; font-size: 3vw;"> 
        Think about it, <b>24-hours</b> of blue light. 
        </div>
        <div id="imgdiv">
            <br>

        Blue light is proven to boost attention and reaction times. WHY else do you think your office has screens on every window?
        <br><br>
        Blue light is proven to shift circadian rhythms 2x more than green light. It tricks our brains into thinking its still daytime.
        <br><br>
        <div style="margin-bottom: 10%;">
         So if you can't get to bed at night, maybe consider what the screens all around you could be doing to your sleep.
