        I can't believe how many of you don't know that THIS is all that's left outside.
        <br><br>
        It's hot and arid, nothing grows in the ground anymore apart from the weeds and heat resistant bushes. 
        <br><br>
        You think that just because you have your fancy screens that you won't have to face the consequences but I hate to break it to you, it WON'T go away just because you refuse to look. 
        <br><br>
        You WILL have to pay attention soon whether you like it or not.
